# Belief Agency

[Visit Site](https://beliefagency.com "Visit Site")

Belief Agency is a creative agency based in Seattle, WA.

BA wanted a site that was flexible, predictable and reflected their unique body of work. They provided the designs and I did the rest. Craft CMS was chosen for its flexibility and ease of use.

The homepage includes a scrolling wall of images that each link to a showcase on that project. Lots of technical steps (such as advanced caching techniques) had to be taken to keep this page performant.
